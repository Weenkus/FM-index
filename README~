FMindex - A compressed full-text substring index based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:
-------------

FMindex creates a full-text compressed index which is used to search for the number of
given substrings.

Using the FMindex you can choose between three diferent data structures:

1. Occurence matrix - slow construction, memory heavy, fast query
2. Byte Wavelet tree - fast construction, memory heavy (better then 1.), slow query
3. Bit Wavelet tree - fast construction, memory efficient, slow query

The FMindex has integrated statistics, which are shown if opted for while running 
the program. Running the statistics part will give you the average build time and the 
average query time for the choosen method (1., 2. or 3.).

This program is constructed for the user to input their own examples. This is done 
simply by changing the contents of the file "ulaz.txt" to the wanted input.
The default contents of "ulaz.txt" are the first 1,000,000 characters of the 
file "sequence Ecoli.fasta" (without the header) and serve as an example.

Happy compressing!
